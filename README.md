My name is Kevin and I live in NYC.

The broad idea behind my work is that **user success is fractal**. For software creators, "making users successful and getting paid for it" is a process that starts by looking at what our users want in their LIVES and how they're trying to GET it. Then it's a matter of recursing downwards and downwards to those aha! interaction moments everyone is talking about.

After all, we never actually buy product features do we? We buy better versions of ourselves.

These days I'm working on <b>CompoundUX</b>, a consultancy that accelerates startups.

The thesis is simple: 

UX compounds, so the most successful user experiences never come from additive improvements, but from <b>exponential</b>Â ones.
