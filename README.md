The broad idea behind my work is that **user success is fractal**, and exists within the context of **life success**. For software creators, "making users successful and getting paid for it" is a process that starts by looking at what our users want in their LIVES and how they're trying to GET it. Then it's a matter of recursing downwards and downwards to those aha! moments.

After all, people don't buy products. They buy better versions of themselves (and tech people are ALWAYS forgetting this.)

These days I'm working on <b>CompoundUX</b>, a software consultancy with a simple thesis:

UX compounds like interest...so the most successful experiences never come from additive changes, but from <b>exponential</b>Â ones that happen far before a purchase is even made.
