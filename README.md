The broad idea behind my work is that **user success is fractal**, and must be examined within the context of **life success**. By life success, what I'm really talking about is that one master self-defining narrative that we all have stuck in our heads.

For software creators, "making users successful and getting paid for it" is a process that starts by looking at what our users want in their LIVES and how they're trying to GET it. 

Then it's a matter of recursing downwards to product experiences, and downwards yet again to those tiny interaction moments.

After all, we don't buy products, do we? We buy better versions of ourselves.
