broad idea behind my work is that **user success is fractal**, and must be examined within the context of **life success**.

For software creators, "making users successful and getting paid for it" is a process that starts by looking at what our users want in their LIVES and how they're trying to GET it. 

Then it's a matter of recursing downwards to 'product' and downwards to 'interaction'.

Because we don't buy products, do we? We buy better versions of ourselves
