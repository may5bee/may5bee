The broad idea behind my work is that **user success is fractal**, and exists within the context of **life success**. For software creators, "making users successful and getting paid for it" is a process that starts by looking at what our users want in their LIVES and how they're trying to GET it. Then it's a matter of recursing downwards and downwards to those aha! moments.

After all, people don't buy products. They buy better versions of themselves.
